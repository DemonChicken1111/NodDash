 ## **FEATURES**

 NodDash is a fully featured activity and data collection backend which utilizes the JSON API provided by Projects Awakening Dev team. You can use NodDash to find your next kill, monitor selling data, or other various stats on any smart deployable in Project Awakening. NodDash is very configurable and code changes are encouraged for users who wish to expand functionality or cutomization.

 NodDash is intended for use on SBC's like Raspberry Pi's, However, it will work on anything with a python interpreter and an internet connection. If you would like to test or mess around with the project virtualization is encouraged if hardware is unavailible. If you would like to virtualize you can read our [virtualization docs](Docs/Virtualization.md), otherwise if you're experienced or have an enviroment already setup you can read the [installation and deployment section](https://github.com/DemonChicken1111/Python-Backend-For-PA?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-and-deployment)
